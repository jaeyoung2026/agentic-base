# Spec Syntax

A spec file is plain Markdown. This document builds up the authoring surface
from simple to complex: headings, shell blocks, doctest blocks, variables,
check tables, hooks, and frontmatter.

## Headings and Prose

Heading hierarchy (`#`, `##`, `###`, ...) is converted into a test suite hierarchy.
Prose paragraphs are preserved in the HTML report but are not execution targets.

## Shell Blocks

`run:shell` fenced blocks are executable — specdown runs them and checks
for zero exit.

The parser must recognize `run` as the executable block kind.

| info      | kind | target |
| --------- | ---- | ------ |
| run:shell | run  | shell  |

Other prefixes (e.g. `verify:`, `test:`) are not recognized and produce
plain, non-executable code blocks. A spec containing only unrecognized
blocks has zero cases. Unrecognized prefixes emit a warning to stderr
so typos like `runn:shell` are caught early.

To suppress warnings for specific prefixes, add `ignorePrefixes` to `specdown.json`.
Plain info strings without a colon (e.g. `json`, `go`, `python`) never warn.

Any executable block can be marked with `!fail` to indicate that failure
is the expected outcome. When the adapter reports failure as expected,
the case is rendered identically to a regular failure — red styling,
failure stats, and red dot markers in the ToC all apply.
The only difference is the exit code: a spec run exits 0
when expected failures are the only failures present.
If the adapter unexpectedly succeeds, the case is a real failure.
`!fail` blocks do not support variable capture (`-> $name`).

```run:shell !fail
false
```

## Summary Lines

If the first line of a `run:` block is a comment,
specdown extracts it as the block's **summary line**.

Consecutive comment lines at the start of a block are joined with a
space into a single summary. The summary ends at the first non-comment
line or blank line.

In the HTML report, blocks with a summary are rendered collapsed:
only the summary text and pass/fail indicator are visible. A `>` marker
on the right side lets readers expand the block to see the full code.
Failed blocks auto-expand so failures are never hidden.

This makes specs readable for non-technical stakeholders without
removing any detail for developers.

The comment prefixes recognized are `# `, `// `, and `-- `.
Only the text after the prefix becomes the summary;
the prefix itself and leading/trailing whitespace are stripped.

Blocks with doctest content (`$ ` lines) never get summaries — they use
a different rendering model with command/output pairs.

Here is an example: the following block's first line is a comment,
so the report will render it collapsed with the summary
"Demonstrate summary line" and a pass/fail indicator.

```run:shell
# Demonstrate summary line
test 1 -eq 1
```

Multiple comment lines are joined into one summary:

```run:shell
# First part of the summary
# and the second part
test 1 -eq 1
```

A block without a leading comment renders normally (not collapsed):

```run:shell
test 1 -eq 1
```

## Doctest Blocks

A `run:<target>` block whose content starts with `$ ` lines is auto-detected
as doctest-style. Lines starting with `$ ` are commands; subsequent lines
until the next `$ ` or end of block are the expected output.

Commands are executed sequentially. On the first output mismatch, the block
fails with `expected` and `actual` values for diffing. Commands without
expected output lines are executed but only checked for exit status.

```run:shell
$ echo hello
hello
$ echo one two three
one two three
```

A doctest-style block with no expected output still verifies the command succeeds.

```run:shell
$ true
```

Multi-line expected output is matched exactly.

```run:shell
$ printf 'line1\nline2\nline3'
line1
line2
line3
```

Arithmetic and pipelines work as expected.

```run:shell
$ echo $((2 + 3))
5
$ seq 3 | tr '\n' '+' | sed 's/+$//'
1+2+3
```

Commands that produce no output show only the prompt line.

```run:shell
$ mkdir -p /tmp/specdown-test
$ touch /tmp/specdown-test/file.txt
$ test -f /tmp/specdown-test/file.txt
```

### Wildcard Matching

A line containing exactly `...` in the expected output matches zero or more
lines in the actual output. To match a literal `...` line, escape it as
`\...`. This is useful when output contains timestamps, PIDs, temporary
paths, or other values that change between runs.

A wildcard in the middle skips variable lines:

```run:shell
$ echo hello && date && echo goodbye
hello
...
goodbye
```

Multiple wildcards can appear in a single expected block:

```run:shell
$ printf 'a\nb\nc\nd\ne'
a
...
c
...
e
```

Escaped wildcard matches literal `...`:

```run:shell
$ echo '...'
\...
```

When no `...` line is present, matching is exact (backward compatible).

```run:shell !fail
$ echo hello
world
```

A doctest block with `!fail` intentionally shows the wrong expected output.
The `!fail` modifier makes the mismatch count as a pass.
On failure, passed steps render in green and the failing step renders
in red with the expected value below.

```run:shell !fail
$ echo hello
goodbye
```

When a case fails, remaining cases continue. Bindings from failed cases
are discarded.

## Variable Capture

A block can capture its output into one or more variables with `-> $varName`.
Multiple captures use comma-separated names: `-> $var1, $var2`.
Each output line is bound to the corresponding capture name in order.

| info             | kind | target |
| ---------------- | ---- | ------ |
| run:shell -> $id | run  | shell  |

Variables captured this way are referenced in subsequent blocks
and tables using `${variableName}`.

When the adapter returns structured (non-string) output, the value is
stored as-is and fields are accessible via dot-path syntax:
`${result.field}`. Nested access works to arbitrary depth:
`${result.outer.inner}`. Accessing a missing key or indexing into a
non-object value is a compile-time error.

### Scoping rules

- Variables from parent sections are readable in child sections
- Sibling sections at the same depth can share variables (in document order, only previously captured values)
- An unresolved variable is a compile-time error

The heading tree enforces a safety property: variables never leak
upward from child to parent sections.

```alloy:model(varscope)
module varscope

sig Section {
  parent: lone Section
}

sig Var {
  definedIn: one Section
}

-- heading hierarchy is a tree
fact tree {
  no s: Section | s in s.^parent
}

-- a variable is visible in its defining section and all descendants
pred visible[v: Var, s: Section] {
  v.definedIn in (s + s.^parent)
}

-- variables from child sections are never visible in ancestors
assert noUpwardLeak {
  all v: Var, s: Section |
    v.definedIn in s.^(~parent) implies not visible[v, s]
}

check noUpwardLeak for 6
```

Variables captured in a parent section are available in child sections.

```run:shell -> $parentVar
printf 'from-parent'
```

#### Child section

```run:shell
test "${parentVar}" = "from-parent"
```

When output has fewer lines than capture names, excess captures receive
empty string.

### Variable escaping

To output a literal `${...}`, escape it with a backslash: `\${literal}`.

```run:shell -> $escapeTest
printf 'ok'
```

```run:shell
test "${escapeTest}" = "ok"
```

## Check Tables

A Markdown table becomes executable when preceded by a check directive.

The directive is a blockquote of the form `> check:name`.
The first row is the header. Each subsequent row is an independent test case.
Check names are defined by the adapter, not the core.

### Cell escaping

Table cells support escape sequences that are processed by the core
before sending to the adapter.

| Sequence | Meaning           |
| -------- | ----------------- |
| `\n`     | newline           |
| `\|`     | literal pipe      |
| `\\`     | literal backslash |

Adapters always receive unescaped values.
The HTML report also unescapes cells, rendering `\n` as visible line breaks.

| input        | expected     |
| ------------ | ------------ |
| hello        | hello        |
| line1\nline2 | line1\nline2 |
| a\\\|b       | a\\\|b       |

### Check parameters

Checks can accept parameters via `(key=value)` syntax.
Parameters are passed to the adapter as `checkParams` in the `assert` message.
Multiple parameters are comma-separated: `> check:name(key1=val1, key2=val2)`.

Parameters let one check definition handle many scenarios.
Instead of registering separate checks for each endpoint or mode,
register a single generic check and pass the differences as parameters:

```markdown
> check:api(endpoint=/api/users, mode=object)
> | field | expected |
> | name | alice |

> check:api(endpoint=/api/orders, mode=array, count=2)
> | index | status |
> | 0 | SUCCESS |
> | 1 | PENDING |
```

The adapter reads `checkParams.endpoint` and `checkParams.mode`
to decide how to fetch and validate, eliminating per-endpoint check code.

When a table column name matches a directive parameter name, the table
cell value takes precedence over the directive value. This allows
directive parameters to act as defaults that individual rows can
override.

### Parameterized check call

A check directive with parameters but no following table creates a single
assertion case. The adapter receives an `assert` message with
the check name, `checkParams` populated, and empty `columns`/`cells`.

This is useful for inline assertions that don't warrant a full table:

```markdown
> check:check-user(field=plan, expected=STANDARD)
```

A check directive without parameters and without a table is a compile-time error.

## Inline Elements

Prose text can contain inline executable elements embedded in backtick code spans.
These are evaluated during the spec run and rendered with pass/fail status in the
HTML report.

### Prose variable rendering

Variables captured by earlier blocks can appear in prose text as `${name}`.
In the HTML report, resolved variables are displayed with their actual values
highlighted in green. Referencing an undefined variable in prose is a
compile-time error, just like in executable blocks.

```markdown
The greeting is ${greeting} and it was captured successfully.
```

### Inline expect

A backtick code span of the form `` `expect: EXPR == VALUE` `` creates an inline
equality assertion. Both sides support `${variable}` substitution. It counts
as a test case and appears green (pass) or red (fail) in the HTML report.

```markdown
The count is `expect: ${count} == 3` items.
```

For example, one plus one is `expect: 2 == 2`.

When the actual value does not match the expected value, the inline assertion
fails and the report shows both the actual value and the expected value.

Adding `!fail` at the end marks the assertion as an expected failure.
The inline value renders identically to a regular failure — red background,
red dot marker, and failure stats all apply. The only difference is
that expected failures do not cause a non-zero exit code.

This deliberately wrong assertion is an expected failure:
`expect: hello == goodbye !fail`.

### Inline check call

A backtick code span of the form `` `check:name(key=value)` `` creates an inline
check assertion. It sends an `assert` message to the adapter with
the check name and `checkParams` populated, with empty `columns`/`cells`.

```markdown
The file `check:file-check(path=/tmp/data.txt, exists=yes)` was created.
```

When the adapter returns an `actual` value in its passed response, the inline
check displays the actual value as the main content with the check name
shown as a small ruby annotation above it.

For example, a + b is `check:jq(input=3, expr=., expected=3)`.

Multiple inline elements can appear in the same paragraph.

## Other Block Prefixes

The target in `run:<target>` names an [adapter](adapter-protocol.spec.md).
The built-in shell adapter works with no configuration; custom adapters
are registered in [`specdown.json`](config.spec.md).

| Prefix                           | Meaning                                                                           |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `run:<target>`                   | Executable block dispatched to an adapter                                         |
| `alloy:model(<name>)`            | Alloy model definition (see [Alloy](alloy.spec.md))                               |
| `alloy:ref(<model>#<assertion>)` | Alloy model reference (see [Alloy](alloy.spec.md))                                |
| `mermaid`                        | Diagram block rendered by Mermaid (see [Report](report.spec.md#mermaid-diagrams)) |

### Diagram Blocks

A fenced code block with `mermaid` as the info string is a **diagram block**.
Diagram blocks are non-executable — they have no test case and are not
dispatched to any adapter. In the HTML report, the content is rendered as
an interactive diagram via the Mermaid library.

The info string match is case-sensitive: `mermaid` is recognized,
but `Mermaid` or `MERMAID` falls through to plain code rendering.

````markdown
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Parse] --> B[Plan]
    B --> C[Execute]
    C --> D[Report]
```
````

## Setup and Teardown Hooks

Hooks run adapter commands at section boundaries.
A hook directive must be followed by an executable code block.

| Directive         | Meaning                                                   |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `> setup`         | Run once before the first case in the heading subtree     |
| `> teardown`      | Run once after the last case in the heading subtree       |
| `> setup:each`    | Run before the first case of each immediate child section |
| `> teardown:each` | Run after the last case of each immediate child section   |

Hooks are not counted as test cases. Their results do not appear in the
case list, but a hook failure marks the document as failed.

### Hook variable visibility

Hooks can read variables captured by blocks in parent sections.
When a hook executes, it receives all bindings visible at the
hook's heading path — the same scoping rules that apply to
regular blocks apply to hooks.

A setup or teardown directive followed by an executable code block must parse successfully.

````run:shell
# Verify spec with setup:each hook parses successfully
mkdir -p .tmp-test
printf '# Hook Test\n\n## Group\n\n> setup:each\n```run:shell\necho init\n```\n\n### Scenario A\n\nSome prose.\n' > .tmp-test/hook-good.spec.md
printf '# T\n\n- [Hook](hook-good.spec.md)\n' > .tmp-test/index.spec.md
cat <<'CFG' > .tmp-test/hook-good-cfg.json
{"entry":"index.spec.md","adapters":[{"name":"s","command":["true"],"blocks":["run:shell"]}]}
CFG
specdown run -config .tmp-test/hook-good-cfg.json -dry-run 2>&1
````

## Frontmatter

An optional YAML frontmatter can be placed at the top of a spec file.

| Key       | Description                                                                                                            |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `timeout` | Per-case execution time limit in milliseconds. Overrides `defaultTimeoutMsec` from config. `0` disables the time limit |
| `type`    | Document type for [traceability](traceability.spec.md) (e.g. `spec`, `goal`, `feature`)                                |

If frontmatter is absent, the global `defaultTimeoutMsec` from `specdown.json` applies (default: 30 seconds).

A spec with a timeout must still pass when the adapter responds quickly.

```run:shell
# Verify spec with YAML frontmatter timeout parses successfully
mkdir -p .tmp-test
cat <<'SPEC' > .tmp-test/timeout.spec.md
---
timeout: 5000
---

# Timeout Test

## Quick

A simple command that completes well within the timeout.
SPEC
printf '# T\n\n- [Timeout](timeout.spec.md)\n' > .tmp-test/index.spec.md
cat <<'CFG' > .tmp-test/timeout-cfg.json
{"entry":"index.spec.md","adapters":[]}
CFG
specdown run -config .tmp-test/timeout-cfg.json -dry-run 2>&1
```
